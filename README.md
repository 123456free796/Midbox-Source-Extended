Here is the code for Midbox, my modification of JummBox (which in turn is a modification of BeepBox) aimed to go far with what is possible.

If you have anything you'd like to bring up to me about then find me in the BeepBox Discord. Do notice that Midbox is currently an unfinished modification in the works, so things may not work at all here.

The update in progress is V0.3. Its release date is still unknown as there are many things to be added, but as of right now I'd say it's possibly around halfway there.

I thank you for your patience. May this mod be of best to you.
